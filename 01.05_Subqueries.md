## Subqueries in SQL

---

### **What Are Subqueries?**

- **Definition:** Subqueries (inner or nested queries) are queries within another SQL query.
- **Purpose:** Allow main queries to depend on results from other queries.
- **Placement:** Used in `SELECT`, `FROM`, or `WHERE` clauses.
- **Syntax:** Enclosed in parentheses and often used with operators like `=`, `IN`, `EXISTS`.

---

### **Use Cases of Subqueries**

1. **Filtering Data:** Filter records based on other query results.
2. **Dynamic Calculations:** Compute values dynamically.
3. **Conditional Updates:** Modify data conditionally in `UPDATE` or `DELETE`.
4. **Returning Multiple Rows/Columns:** Perform complex filtering.
5. **Data Aggregation:** Group or conditionally analyze data.

### **Types of Subqueries**

1. **Single-Row Subquery:**

   - Returns one row.
   - Common Operators: `=`, `<`, `>`, `<>`.
   - **Example:**
     ```sql
     SELECT Name, Salary
     FROM Employee
     WHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employee);
     ```

2. **Multi-Row Subquery:**

   - Returns multiple rows.
   - Operators: `IN`, `ANY`, `ALL`.
   - **Example:**
     ```sql
     SELECT Name
     FROM Employee
     WHERE DepartmentID IN (SELECT DepartmentID FROM Department WHERE LocationID = 2);
     ```

3. **Scalar Subquery:**

   - Returns one value (single column and row).
   - Used in `SELECT` or `WHERE` clauses.
   - **Example:**
     ```sql
     SELECT Name, (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee) AS MaxSalary FROM Employee;
     ```

4. **Correlated Subquery:**
   - Depends on the outer queryâ€™s values.
   - Executes once for each outer query row.
   - **Example:**
     ```sql
     SELECT Name
     FROM Employee e
     WHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employee WHERE DepartmentID = e.DepartmentID);
     ```

---

### **Performance Considerations**

- **Correlated Subqueries:** Inefficient for large datasets as they execute multiple times.
- **Alternatives:** Use `JOINs` for better performance in most cases.
- **Example with JOIN:**
  ```sql
  SELECT e.Name, AVG(s.Salary)
  FROM Employee e
  JOIN Salaries s ON e.EmployeeID = s.EmployeeID
  GROUP BY e.DepartmentID;
  ```

### **Common Use Cases and Queries**

1. **Find Employees with Salaries Above the Average:**

   ```sql
   SELECT Name
   FROM Employee
   WHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employee);
   ```

2. **List Departments with Employees Earning Over $70,000:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT DepartmentName
   FROM Department
   WHERE DepartmentID IN (SELECT DepartmentID FROM Employee WHERE Salary > 70000);
   ```

3. **Retrieve Managers:**

   ```sql
   SELECT Name
   FROM Employee
   WHERE EmployeeID IN (SELECT ManagerID FROM Employee WHERE ManagerID IS NOT NULL);
   ```

4. **Departments Without Employees:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DepartmentName
   FROM Department
   WHERE DepartmentID NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT DepartmentID FROM Employee);
   ```

5. **Employees in Departments Located in 'New York':**

   ```sql
   SELECT Name
   FROM Employee
   WHERE DepartmentID IN (
       SELECT DepartmentID
       FROM Department
       WHERE LocationID IN (SELECT LocationID FROM Locations WHERE LocationName = 'New York')
   );
   ```

6. **Find Employees Without Managers:**
   ```sql
   SELECT Name
   FROM Employee
   WHERE ManagerID IS NULL;
   ```

### **Subqueries vs. JOINs**

| **Aspect**      | **Subqueries**                               | **JOINs**                                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Use Case**    | Dynamic filtering or single-value retrieval. | Combining related data from multiple tables. |
| **Performance** | Slower for correlated subqueries.            | More efficient with large datasets.          |
| **Complexity**  | More complex when nested.                    | Clearer relationships between tables.        |
| **Readability** | Less readable for multi-level nesting.       | Easier to understand relationships.          |

---

### **Nested Subqueries**

- **Definition:** Subqueries within another subquery.
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  SELECT Name
  FROM Employee
  WHERE DepartmentID IN (
      SELECT DepartmentID
      FROM Department
      WHERE LocationID IN (
          SELECT LocationID
          FROM Locations
          WHERE LocationName = 'New York'
      )
  );
  ```

---

### **Use of `EXISTS`**

- Tests for the existence of rows in a subquery.
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  SELECT Name
  FROM Employee e
  WHERE EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM Department d
      WHERE d.DepartmentID = e.DepartmentID AND d.LocationID = 3
  );
  ```

### **Key Takeaways**

- Use subqueries for dynamic or nested logic where single-value or specific filters are needed.
- Prefer `JOINs` for combining related data efficiently.
- Optimize performance by reducing correlated subquery use in favor of aggregations or indexed `JOINs`.
