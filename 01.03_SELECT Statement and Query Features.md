## SELECT Statement and Query Features

---

### **SELECT Statement**

- **Purpose:** Used to retrieve data from a database, returning a result table (result set).
- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  SELECT column1, column2, ...
  FROM table_name;
  ```

---

### **Examples**

1. **Basic SELECT:**

   - Retrieve specific columns:
     ```sql
     SELECT first_name, last_name, department
     FROM employee;
     ```
   - Result: List of employees with their first name, last name, and department.

2. **Conditional SELECT:**
   - Retrieve rows with conditions:
     ```sql
     SELECT first_name, last_name, salary
     FROM employee
     WHERE salary > 60000;
     ```
   - Result: Employees earning more than 60,000.

### **Filtering Data with WHERE**

- **Purpose:** Filters records based on conditions.
- **Common Operators:**
  - `=` (Equal), `!=` or `<>` (Not Equal), `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
  - `BETWEEN`, `LIKE`, `IN`, `IS NULL`

**Example:**

- Filter by department:
  ```sql
  SELECT first_name, last_name, department
  FROM employee
  WHERE department = 'Sales';
  ```

---

### **Filtering with AND, OR, Parentheses**

- **AND:** Both conditions must be true.
- **OR:** Either condition can be true.
- **Parentheses:** Group conditions to control logic.

**Example:**

- Combine conditions:
  ```sql
  SELECT first_name, last_name, salary
  FROM employee
  WHERE (department = 'Sales' OR department = 'Marketing')
  AND salary > 70000;
  ```

---

### **Sorting Data with ORDER BY**

- **Purpose:** Sort results in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order.
- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  SELECT column1, column2
  FROM table_name
  ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC];
  ```

**Examples:**

1. **Sort by salary (ascending):**
   ```sql
   SELECT first_name, salary
   FROM employee
   ORDER BY salary ASC;
   ```
2. **Sort by department and salary:**
   ```sql
   SELECT department, salary
   FROM employee
   ORDER BY department ASC, salary DESC;
   ```

---

### **Aliasing (AS)**

- **Purpose:** Rename columns or tables in the query results for better readability.
- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  SELECT column_name AS alias_name
  FROM table_name;
  ```

**Example:**

- Rename columns:
  ```sql
  SELECT first_name AS 'First Name', last_name AS 'Last Name'
  FROM employee;
  ```

---

### **LIMIT and OFFSET**

- **Purpose:** Restrict or paginate results.
- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  SELECT column1, column2
  FROM table_name
  LIMIT number_of_rows OFFSET skip_rows;
  ```

**Example:**

- Retrieve the first 5 rows after skipping 10:
  ```sql
  SELECT first_name, department
  FROM employee
  LIMIT 5 OFFSET 10;
  ```

---

### **Advanced Query Examples**

1. **Top Salaries in Engineering:**

   ```sql
   SELECT first_name, salary
   FROM employee
   WHERE department = 'Engineering' AND salary > 70000
   ORDER BY salary DESC
   LIMIT 3;
   ```

2. **Hires After 2015 with Pagination:**

   ```sql
   SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS 'Full Name', department, hire_date
   FROM employee
   WHERE hire_date > '2015-01-01'
   ORDER BY hire_date DESC
   LIMIT 5 OFFSET 3;
   ```

3. **Exclude HR and Find Top Salaries:**

   ```sql
   SELECT first_name, salary
   FROM employee
   WHERE department != 'HR'
   ORDER BY salary DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

4. **Filter and Group by Department with Sorting:**
   ```sql
   SELECT first_name, department, salary
   FROM employee
   WHERE department IN ('Sales', 'Marketing')
   ORDER BY salary ASC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

### **Edge Cases for LIMIT and OFFSET**

- **Performance Issues:** Large `OFFSET` values can degrade performance.
- **Dynamic Datasets:** Data changes may cause inconsistent pagination.
- **Non-Deterministic Ordering:** Ensure unique and consistent `ORDER BY` for reliable results.

**Alternative:** Use keyset pagination for better performance:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employee
WHERE id > last_retrieved_id
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 10;
```
