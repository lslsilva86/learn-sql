## Window Functions in SQL

---

### **What Are Window Functions?**

- **Definition:** Allow calculations across a subset of rows (window) without collapsing them like aggregate functions.
- **Use Cases:** Running totals, moving averages, rankings, and row comparisons.
- **Components:**
  - **`OVER` Clause:** Defines the window.
  - **`PARTITION BY`:** Divides data into groups for separate calculations.
  - **`ORDER BY`:** Orders rows within partitions for ranking and cumulative functions.
  - **Window Frame:** Specifies a subset of rows for the calculation (e.g., `ROWS BETWEEN`).

### **Advantages of Window Functions**

1. Perform row-by-row analysis while retaining original rows.
2. Simplify complex analytics like ranking and cumulative metrics.
3. Operate efficiently on defined partitions and orderings.
4. Enable dynamic calculations without collapsing data like `GROUP BY`.

### **Types of Window Functions**

1. **Aggregate Window Functions:**

   - Perform aggregations within partitions or across rows.
   - Examples:
     - `SUM()`: Running total.
     - `AVG()`: Group average.
     - `COUNT()`: Row count.
     - `MIN()/MAX()`: Min/Max value.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT department, SUM(salary) OVER(PARTITION BY department) AS cumulative_salary FROM employees;
     ```

2. **Ranking Functions:**

   - Assign ranks or numbers to rows within partitions.
   - Examples:
     - `ROW_NUMBER()`: Unique row number.
     - `RANK()`: Rank with gaps for ties.
     - `DENSE_RANK()`: Rank without gaps.
     - `NTILE(n)`: Divides rows into `n` groups.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT department, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank FROM employees;
     ```

3. **Value-Based Functions:**

   - Retrieve specific values relative to current rows.
   - Examples:
     - `LAG()`: Previous row value.
     - `LEAD()`: Next row value.
     - `FIRST_VALUE()`: First value in the window.
     - `LAST_VALUE()`: Last value in the window.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT employee_id, LAG(salary) OVER(PARTITION BY department ORDER BY hire_date) AS previous_salary FROM employees;
     ```

4. **Statistical Functions:**
   - Compute variance or standard deviation.
   - Examples:
     - `VARIANCE()`: Measures data spread.
     - `STDDEV()`: Standard deviation.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT department, VARIANCE(salary) OVER(PARTITION BY department) AS variance FROM employees;
     ```

### **Window Frame Clauses**

Define the subset of rows within a partition for a function:

- **Frame Types:**
  - `ROWS`: Specific number of rows.
  - `RANGE`: Based on value ranges.
- **Boundaries:**
  - `UNBOUNDED PRECEDING`: Start of partition.
  - `CURRENT ROW`: Current row only.
  - `n PRECEDING/FOLLOWING`: n rows before/after.
- **Examples:**
  - Running Total:
    ```sql
    SUM(salary) OVER(ORDER BY hire_date ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW);
    ```
  - Moving Average:
    ```sql
    AVG(salary) OVER(ORDER BY hire_date ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW);
    ```

### **Limitations of Window Functions**

1. Performance overhead on large datasets.
2. Cannot be used in `WHERE` or `HAVING` clauses directly.
3. Limited nesting support.
4. Partitioning and ordering must be clearly defined for meaningful results.

---

### **Example Queries**

1. **Cumulative Salary by Department:**

   ```sql
   SELECT department_id, employee_id, SUM(salary) OVER(PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY hire_date) AS cumulative_salary FROM employees;
   ```

2. **Compare Current vs. Previous Salary:**

   ```sql
   SELECT employee_id, salary, LAG(salary) OVER(PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY hire_date) AS previous_salary FROM employees;
   ```

3. **Moving Average of Salary (Last 3 Hires):**

   ```sql
   SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) OVER(PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY hire_date ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS moving_avg_salary FROM employees;
   ```

4. **Top 3 Salaries by Department:**

   ```sql
   SELECT department_id, employee_id, salary, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank FROM employees WHERE rank <= 3;
   ```

5. **Future Salary (LEAD):**
   ```sql
   SELECT employee_id, salary, LEAD(salary) OVER(PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY hire_date) AS next_salary FROM employees;
   ```

### **Conclusion**

Window functions are essential for advanced data analysis, offering the ability to calculate metrics like running totals, rankings, and comparisons without losing the row-level detail. Proper usage of partitions, ordering, and frame clauses can unlock powerful analytical insights efficiently.
